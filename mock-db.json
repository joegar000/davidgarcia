As my first blog post, I'd like to take some time to introduce myself and what explain what my intentions for this website are.</p><p></p><h5>A little about myself</h5><p>When I was a senior in high school, I was torn between majoring in music and computer science. I'd been playing piano since I was about 3 years old and I had never programmed before. However, as much as I liked piano, I had doubts about a career in piano performance. Playing complex classical pieces in front of a large audience is stressful! Plus, while classical music is cool, it's not really the kind of music I like to listen to (although I do enjoy a good&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzCL9uLkQSI\" title=\"winter in F minor\">Winter in F minor</a>&nbsp;on the occasion). So I decided to declare myself a major in computer science with a minor in music.</p><p>I dropped the music minor after my first semester, figuring that I can learn at my own pace by myself instead of having to worry about being graded for it, and swapped it for a math minor.</p><p>Programming was awkward at first. I had a lot of questions like: why is there more than one language and why don't my programs have user interfaces. Since then, my knowledge has matured so that I now ask questions like: how do I pick a language and why don't my programs have good user interfaces.</p><p></p><h5>My goal for this website</h5><p>As you may or may not have guessed, I am not the most experienced software developer. But that's okay! At the time of writing this blog post, I've been working full-time for a year and, although the novelty has worn off little, my curiosity towards about my field is only growing more intense. I plan for my blog posts to<em> mostly</em>&nbsp;be about things I've learned or things I'm currently learning about computer science and software development. When I explain a concept, I want to explain it in the most understandable way as possible, that way my friends and family that aren't familiar with programming can follow along, and for me to practice communicating complicated concepts in a straightforward manner. I also want to start doing solo projects and post them here as/once I build them.</p><p></p><p>That's all! Nothing too lengthy this time, but I can't promise that for later posts...</p></div>",
