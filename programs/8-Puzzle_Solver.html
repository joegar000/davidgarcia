                <p>In Spring 2020 I took a class titled Algorithms Design and Analysis. Although it was a
                    difficult class, when I look back I realize that not only am I grateful for what the class
                    taught me, but I also enjoyed completing the assignments. The last assignment was to create
                    an 8-puzzle solver (it could also solve any n-by-n puzzle). The completed assignment had
                    three classes, one that defined the board, one that solved the desired puzzle using the A*
                    search algorithm, and one used to test the code. Some basic information was provided as a
                    place to start with the assignment (method names and descriptions of what they should
                    accomplish). It took me some time to complete it, but it passed all of my debugging and
                    I was able to submit it on time.</p>
                    
                <p>This code defines the board class. It can be used to create a board object where the board is of size n-by-n.</p>
